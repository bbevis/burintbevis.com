I am a computational social scientist studying how people with different views, interests and priorities can collaborate constructively. I’m especially interested in how people can stand their ground, challenge one another, and still make progress without damaging relationships. I combine experiments with computational tools (NLP, multimodal models, and large language models) to analyze behaviors in communication in fine-grained detail and zoom in on the moments that matter most.

Constructive disagreement matters because it’s how groups push through impasses on hard problems and make progress together. We need it to tackle divisive issues like climate policy in ways that are both effective and broadly acceptable. We also need it at work when people have competing interests and priorities, and in science when collaborators disagree about which direction a project should take.

Outside of research, I was lucky enough to grow up in both Thailand and the UK. I love a spicy curry as much as a Sunday roast, and I’m equally happy on a beautiful beach or on a long walk along the Thames stopping off at galleries and cafes—proof (I like to think) that it’s possible to hold divergent interests.
