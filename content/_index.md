I’m a computational social scientist who combines NLP, multimodal models, and large language models with experiments to study a pressing question: how can people on opposing sides disagree constructively? Disagreement might be uncomfortable, but when managed well, it helps teams surface new ideas, test and refine them, and tackle complex problems.

Constructive disagreement is essential for moving complex, divisive issues forward—whether we’re debating hot-button political issues like immigration policy or climate action, deciding on the direction of scientific research, or helping work teams align on a strategy when priorities and incentives differ.

My work spans three connected lines of research. First, I study how choices made *before* disagreements shape the behaviors and outcomes that follow. Second, I examine what happens *during* disagreement using multimodal models that integrates verbal and nonverbal cues at the speaker-turn level. Third, I extend this work to broader societal outcomes—what happens when opposing sides struggle to engage with one another constructively, including how polarization, social media use, and political orientation relate to wellbeing.
